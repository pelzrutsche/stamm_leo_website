<phpcms:ignore>
This file (options.de.htm) is the phpCMS source file for options.en.html.
To keep the HTML file up to date, parse this file with phpCMS 1.2.0 after every change 
and save that HTML code as options.en.html.

<anchor="page_extension">
<h2>Page Extension to be parsed</h2>
<h3>Extension of content files to be parsed by phpCMS</h3>

<p>Each file has an extension. HTML-files usually end with ".html" or ".htm".<br />
This setting tells phpCMS what extension files have that it should look out for and parse.
<br />
In addition the web server has to be configured so as to send files with this extension to the parser (e.g. via a .htaccess file).
<br />
<br />Default configuration is ".htm".<br />
Regular HTML-files might be given the extension ".html" and phpCMS-files the extension ".htm". But even ".htm"-files that do not contain phpCMS fields would be passed through unchanged.<BACKLINK></p>

<anchor="page_defaultname">
<h2>Name of Default Page</h2>
<h3>Page to display when directory is requested</h3>

<p>When a client sends a request that does not specify a page name phpCMS will try to display this page.
<br />
<br />Example: If your default page is set to "index" and your page extension is ".htm", then a request for http://server.com/docs/ would return http://server.com/docs/index.htm, if it exists.<BACKLINK></p>

<h3>File extension of template files</h3>

<p>The file extension used for templates can of course also be chosen freely.

<anchor="pax">
<h2>Use PAXPHP in your files</h2>
<h3>Parse embedded PHP code</h3>

<p>PAXPHP lets you use regular PHP code within content, and template files.<br />
So called DynaTags are an application of PAXPHP. DynaTags are user-defined tags that are substituted by a PHP expression marked up as PAXPHP<BACKLINK></p>

<anchor="paxtags">
<h2>Parse PAX TAGS</h2>
<h3>Execute hard coded PAX TAGS</h3>

<p>PAX TAGS are special functions that are hard coded within the PAX-Module.<br />
Available PAX TAGS are: PAXINC, PAXLASTMOD, PAXCOMBO, PAXCOMBOALL, PAXMENU, PAXHIGLIGHT and PAXRTF.<BACKLINK></p>

<anchor="mail2crypt"></a>
<h2>Mail2Crypt (Anti Spam)</h2>
<h3>Hide e-mail addresses from SPAM bots</h3>

<p>By using a tag like &lt;!-- MAIL2CRYPT mail@domain.xyz --&gt; e-mail addresses are scrambled on the fly to protect them from being harvested by SPAM bots. When turned off, addresses inside the tag are displayed as plain text. Mail2Crypt is configurable. See the manual for details. (Currently still under <q>PAX</q>)
<br />
<br />In phpCMS 1.2.0 and higher Mail2Crypt is fully integrated into the Parser and works independent of PAX.<BACKLINK></p>

<anchor="mail2crypt_js">
<h2>Mail2Crypt JavaScript Directory</h2>
<h3>Path to Mail2Crypt JS file</h3>

<p>Here you may specify the path to the directory that contains the Mail2Crypt JavaScript file. The file "js_mail2crypt.js" which is needed to display scrambled e-mail addresses in the browser is located in the document root by default.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Server-Cache -->

<anchor="cache_state">
<anchor="cache_dir">
<h2>Server Cache / Server Cache Directory</h2>
<h3>Allow storage and reuse of parsed pages on the server</h3>

<p>Pages and parts of pages that have already been parsed by phpCMS can be stored (cached) on the server for reuse. A page thus cached does not have to be re-parsed on subsequent requests. Through this technique phpCMS significantly reduces the server&#8217;s response time.
<br />
<br />When deactivating this feature the server cache needs to be cleaned (flushed) manually since pages still in the cache otherwise remain to be served to visitors.</p>
<p>Note to Linux users: PHP needs to have write access to the cache directory. Should you not want to grant write access - e.g. for security reasons - the phpCMS cache feature can not be used.<BACKLINK></p>

<anchor="cache_client">
<h2>Client Cache</h2>
<h3>Allow storage of pages in the browser</h3>

<p>Gives visitor&#8217;s browsers permission to store pages in their local cache. This setting takes effect for pages that are, or could be, cached server side. If this is not the case (e.g. because pages contain dynamic plug-ins) phpCMS deactivates this setting automatically.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Speicherzeit Proxy/Client-Cache -->

<anchor="proxy_cache_time">
<h2>Live time of Proxy/Client Cache in days:</h2>
<h3>Amount of time pages may be stored by clients</h3>

<p>Specifies the amount of time clients are allowed to keep pages stored in local cache. After this time clients must send a request for a fresh copy of a page. This setting will be ignored if pages contain dynamic content, i.e. scripts or dynamic plug-ins.
<br />
<br />A value of "1"  means that proxy servers or clients must request a fresh copy of a page after one day.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- G-Zip Compression -->

<anchor="gzip">
<h2>G-Zip Compression</h2>
<h3>Compress pages before transmission</h3>

<p>Specifies whether G-Zip compression should be used to transmit pages if available. All of today&#8217;s major browsers can handle G-Zip compressed files.
<br />
<br />With this option switched on HTML files will be compressed in size by up to 70% before they are transmitted over the Internet. Pages thus transmitted load faster in your visitors&#8217; browsers, and cause less traffic volume on your server!
<br />
<br />This feature can be used only if PHP runs with the "zlib" extension loaded. Please refer to the PHP documentation for further details...<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- File-Stealth-Mode -->

<anchor="stealth">
<h2>File-Stealth-Mode</h2>
<h3>Make URLs search engine friendly</h3>

<p>Use of this feature is recommended.
<br />In Stealth-Mode pages are accessed through <q>normal</q> looking URLs, i.e. without the <q>parser.php?file=</q> showing in the address bar. This makes sure that pages can be found and are indexed by search engines. Search engines often will not index pages whose URL contains a <q>?</q>!
<br />
<br />Stealth-Mode requires that you be able to use .htaccess files to configure your server. If you cannot use .htaccess files and cannot configure your server so that ".htm" files will be parsed by phpCMS, this feature must be deactivated. <BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Secure Stealth-Mode -->

<anchor="stealth_secure">
<h2>Secure Stealth-Mode</h2>
<h3>Disallow access to secured directories</h3>

<p>Use of this feature is recommended.<br />
Secure Stealth-Mode blocks requests via <q>parser.php?file=filename.htm</q> to prevent unauthorized access to files located in directories secured through a .htaccess file.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Fixe Endungen im Normal-Mode -->

<anchor="nolinkchange">
<h2>Non-changeable extensions in Non-Stealth-Mode</h2>
<h3>File types not to be sent to the Parser</h3>

<p>Specifies extensions of files references to which, in Non-Stealth-Mode, should not be changed to "parser.php?file=".
<br />
<br />In Non-Stealth-Mode HTML links are automatically converted so that requests are correctly sent to the Parser. Here you may specify those kinds of files links to which should remain unchanged.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Fehler bei leerem TAG -->

<anchor="tags_error">
<h2>Error on empty TAG</h2>
<h3>Handling of empty substitute tags</h3>

<p>With this option activated an error-message will be displayed should a tag be encountered that does not have its substitution string defined.
<br />
When deactivated, such a tag will be substituted with an empty string, i.e. it will not produce any output in the parsed page.<BACKLINK></p>

                                     <!-- Debug-Modus -->

<anchor="debug">
<h2>Debug-Mode</h2>
<h3>Display error messages during development cycle</h3>

<p>When Debug-Mode is activated phpCMS&#8217;s internal error messages will be displayed if a file cannot be found or some other error occurs.
<br />
<br />In Debug-Mode you may also use the phpCMS Debug-Tool. The Debug-Tool can be accessed by appending <q>?debug</q> to the URL of any content page.
<BACKLINK></p>

									 <!-- Error-Page -->

<anchor="error_page">
<anchor="error_page_404"></a>
<h2>Custom Error-Page / Custom 404-Error-Page</h2>
<h3>Use of customized error pages</h3>

<p>
When Debug-Mode is not activated, the Error-Page will be displayed should phpCMS encounter an internal error condition.
<br />
<br />Special treatment is given to <q>Error 404s</q>. Since, from the server&#8217;s perspective, the file <q>parser.php</q> is the only one that is ever requested, the server cannot detect a missing content page and, consequently, cannot generate a 404 error message.
<br />
<br />The difference between the regular <q>Error-Page</q> and the 404-Error-Page is that the 404-Error-Page is not sent via HTTP redirect, but instead is send directly by and though the parser. This way the status of the browser address bar remains unchanged.
<br />
<br />In the event that no 404-Error-Page is specified or none exists, the regular Error-Page will be displayed.<BACKLINK></p>
