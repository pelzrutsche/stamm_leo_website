<h2>Why Another Content Management System?</h2><p>
There is no shortage of available software packages to manage web sites. There are numerous, well-established content management systems available commercially and as open source software. Many of the available systems are excellent options and provide excellent user support, mature development platforms, large developer and user communities and in some cases thousands of available third-party add-ons to meet almost every customization need.
</p><p>
What there is a shortage of is well-written, easy-to-use lightweight content management systems for small web sites. The available options for small web site owners are very limited and in most cases force the web site owner to choose a system that has far more features and far more complexity than are needed. 
</p><h2>What Is A Small Web Site?</h2><p>
What I define as a small web site is one which has fewer than 3 site managers. In most cases, the site owner is the only site manager. A small web site is also one which is comprised of fewer than 100 pages and perhaps two or three page layouts or templates. This type of web site is commonly referred to as a brochure style web site.
</p><p>
SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS was designed specifically to fill the gap in options for the small web site owner. The owner of a small web site may be a small business owner, an individual or small organization.
</p><p>
SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS is built to provide the small web site owner with an easy-to-use web site manager. There is only as much complexity as is absolutely necessary. SkyBlueCanvas is not intended to meet every web site need nor to compete
with larger systems. The software is intended for small web sites,
which account for the majority of sites on the world wide web.
</p><h2>What Is Included</h2><p>
SkyBlueCanvas is simple but definitely not simplistic. The software includes many features to allow it to be customized and adapted to a variety of needs. These features include:
</p><ul>
    <li>Extensibile Core through Content Managers and Modules</li>
    <li>Plugin API to allow code execution triggered on custom events</li>
    <li>Skinnability through HTML/CSS templates</li></ul><h2>What Is Left Out</h2><p>
Because SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS is built for small web sites, many features needed to support larger sites have been left out. Among these are:
</p><ul>
    <li>No database is required</li>
    <li>Zero configuration - just upload it to your web server and start using it</li>
    <li>No complicated User Management (<acronym title="Access Control List">ACL</acronym>)</li>
    <li>No complex content hierarchies (Sections, Categories, etc.)</li></ul>
