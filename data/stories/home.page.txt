In lay terms, a content management system is a software tool that allows a web site owner to change the text and pictures on their web site without the help of a programmer and without being required to have any knowledge of the underlying technologies. SkyBlueCanvas, and most other CMSs, do require a programmer or other person knowledgeable about web sites and web servers to perform the initial set up, but after that almost anyone can update the text and pictures on the site.</p><p>When we say that SkyBlueCanvas is lightweight, we mean two things: it is smaller in terms of the total amount of space it takes up on your computer or web server, and that it is designed for small web sites. We define a small web site as a site that has fewer than 100 pages. For more details, please see the <a href="about.html">About</a> page on this site.</p><h3>SkyBlueCanvas is Open Source and Free Software</h3><p>SkyBlueCanvas is open source, which means that you can download the source code and modify it to fit your needs.
